The section "Reproducibility" contain links to working Kaggle notebooks which are easy to reproduce on Kaggle.

For the sake of completeness let us duplicate it here.


Source code is here available in the notebooks:
Pyboost: [the basic baseline notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/alexandervc/pyboost-secret-grandmaster-s-tool),  other version of the PYBOOST are in the [notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/alexandervc/pyboost-u900).

Catboost [Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/alexandervc/fork-of-op2-oof-new-folds-v3-catboost) , [version 64, scores 0.584, 0.776](https://www.kaggle.com/code/alexandervc/fork-of-op2-oof-new-folds-v3-catboost?scriptVersionId=152513917)


MLP-like Neural Networks employing target encoding [Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/antoninadolgorukova/op2-simple-mlp-part-of-13th-place-solution), params used during the challenge: [notebook version 52](https://www.kaggle.com/code/antoninadolgorukova/op2-simple-mlp-part-of-13th-place-solution?scriptVersionId=153981848).

Neural Networks based on NLP-like SMILES embedding - [the main notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/alexandervc/nlp-regression-custom-kfold-update1), the submission with 0.574 (0.766 private) score is [version 11](https://www.kaggle.com/code/alexandervc/nlp-regression-custom-kfold-update1?scriptVersionId=151529557).


Blend: [Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/alexandervc/op2-u900-team-blend)

Most of our submissions can be found in the Kaggle datasets [submits and out-of-fold predictions](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexandervc/open-problems-single-cell-perturbations-submitsetc), [Open Problems 2 Submits, etc](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexandervc/open-problems-2-submits-etc)

Information on all submits with public and private is in the [file](https://www.kaggle.com/code/alexandervc/op2-public-vs-private-scores/output?select=df_stat_submissions.csv)

Our initial PYBOOST notebook has been openly shared and forked about 100 times, being a component of top public solo models as well as  many medal winning solutions - probably the best indication of the reproducibility.
